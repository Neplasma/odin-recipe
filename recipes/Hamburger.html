    <h2>Hamburger recipe</h2>
    <p>In my youth, I learned how to make hamburgers from a celebrity chef who insisted that you needed breadcrumbs, egg and seasonings for a truly great burger. And that’s how I made it for years, thinking that was the right way.

        After multiple trips to the States (sorry Australia, but no one does burgers like America!), too many burgers, and watching countless cooking shows, meeting chefs, caterers and restauranteurs, I’ve been converted to the right way.
        
        A great beef hamburger patty requires nothing more than beef.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>800g - 1kg / 1.6 - 2 lb ground beef (mince), 20%+ fat</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        <li>3 onions, peeled and sliced into rings</li>
        <li>2 tbsp oil</li>
        <li>4 - 8 slices cheese of choice, I use Swiss (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Separate beef into 4 equal portions. Use hands to lightly form into patties the size of your buns (mine are about 10 cm / 4") - don't press hard, light fingers = soft juicy patties (see video for how I do this).</li>
        <li>Season generously with salt and pepper on both sides. Make a dent on one side (stop burger from become dome shape and shrinking when cooking).</li>
        <li>Season generously with salt and pepper on both sides. Make a dent on one side (stop burger from become dome shape and shrinking when cooking).</li>
        <li>Heat 1 tbsp oil until smoking. Add patties and cook for 2 minutes until deep golden with a great crust. Do not press! Flip carefully, cook for 1 minute then top with cheese (if using). Cover with lid and cook for further 1 minute until cheese is melted.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, toast the cut side of the buns lightly.</li>
        <li>To serve: Spread base of buns with sauce / condiment of choice. Top with lettuce then tomato, then hamburger patty. Pile over onions, sliced pickles, then more sauce/condiments. Top with lid of bun. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
