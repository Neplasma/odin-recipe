    <!--Description-->
    <h2>Delicious Traditional Italian Lasagna</h2>
    <p>I’m going to call it (obnoxious as it is) – this fried chicken is better than KFC. There’s not a trace of soggy skin anywhere (all you closet KFC lovers know exactly what I’m talking about!) and the crust is thicker and craggier.

        Every inch of this crust is insanely crunchy, and there’s loads of those nubbly bits that get extra crunchy. The seasoning is satisfyingly spot on – strong but not outrageously overpowering – the buttermilk marinated flesh is tender and juicy all the way through, and the deep golden colour is sheer perfection.
        
        Seriously, what kind of human being could resist a piping hot pile of freshly made fried chicken?? {Vegetarians are excused}</p>
